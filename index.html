    <h2> <q>Is it a <span class="good">good</span> thing? Is that a <span class="bad">bad </span>thing? I don't know.</q></h2>

    <h3>In nature, Good & Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither <span class="good">good</span> nor <span class="bad">bad</span>, but a potential in permanent development.</h3>


    <h4>In life, there are 4 types of people..</h4>
      <ul>
       <li>people who think the Internet is <span class="good">good</span>,</li>
       <li>people who think the Internet is evil,</li>
       <li>people who think the Internet is cats,</li>
       <li>people who don't think about it.</li>
    </ul>

Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems.
<br>
Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue.
<br>
Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.
<br>
Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes.
<br>
That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example.
<br>
If we mis translate the message, our reality changes.
<br>
If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way.
<br>
Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.
<br>
They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine.
<br>
Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently.
<br>
But the person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

<br>

Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
<br>
That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
<br>
They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.
<br>
” The farmer said, “Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”
<br>
The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events.
<br>
You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.” 
<br>
The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
<br>
The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,” and the farmer responded, “Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”
<br>
The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
<br>
Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “Is it  <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”
<br>
The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of<span class="good">good</span> fortune.

<h5 align="center">Conclusion</h5>
<br>  
<span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
